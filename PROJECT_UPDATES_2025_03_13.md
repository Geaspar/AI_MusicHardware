## Sequencer Development Progress

We've been developing a music software instrument with a focus on the sequencer component. Here's what we've done:

### Recent Progress:
1. **Improved the Sequencer Implementation**
   - Fully implemented the `Pattern` class for storing note sequences
   - Enhanced the `Sequencer` class with proper time-based playback
   - Added support for multiple patterns, looping, and tempo control

2. **Created Testing Tools**
   - Developed `TestSequencer.cpp` - An interactive test for real-time audio
   - Created `TestSequencerFile.cpp` - Generates WAV files from sequencer patterns without requiring real-time audio
   - Added patterns for testing: scales, chords, and arpeggios

3. **Build System Updates**
   - Modified CMakeLists.txt to incorporate sequencer components
   - Added targets for the new test programs
   - Created a library structure to manage dependencies

### Current Status:
- We have build issues with RtAudio compatibility in AudioEngine.cpp
- The non-real-time sequencer test `TestSequencerFile.cpp` is ready to build
- The real-time tests require further audio engine fixes

### Sequencer Implementation Completed:

The sequencer implementation is now complete with the following enhanced features:

1. **Note Management**
   - Added support for MIDI notes with velocity, duration, start time, and channel
   - Implemented note adding, removal, and manipulation
   - Added pattern management with multiple patterns support

2. **Playback Features**
   - Added robust timing with beat-based position tracking
   - Implemented proper note triggering with start/end time handling
   - Added looping support with tempo control

3. **Advanced Features**
   - Implemented quantization to snap notes to a grid
   - Added swing/groove capability for more natural rhythmic feel
   - Created a song arrangement system for sequencing multiple patterns
   - Added MIDI file export for saving patterns and songs

4. **Testing Applications**
   - Added file-based test for generating WAV files from patterns
   - Created a full-featured interactive test application (`TestSequencerAdvanced.cpp`)
   - Added support for song arranging and testing

5. **Integration**
   - Updated build system to include new components
   - Ensured compatibility with existing audio systems

### Key Files Being Worked On:
- `/src/sequencer/Sequencer.cpp` - Main sequencer implementation
- `/include/sequencer/Sequencer.h` - Sequencer interface
- `/src/sequencer/MidiFile.cpp` - MIDI file export functionality
- `/include/sequencer/MidiFile.h` - MIDI file export interface
- `/examples/TestSequencerFile.cpp` - File-based testing program
- `/examples/TestSequencer.cpp` - Interactive real-time testing program
- `/examples/TestSequencerAdvanced.cpp` - Advanced features testing program
- `CMakeLists.txt` - Build system configuration

### Next Steps:
1. Test the sequencer functionality using the TestSequencerFile and TestSequencerAdvanced approaches
2. Fix RtAudio compatibility issues in AudioEngine.cpp
3. Integrate the sequencer with the AI components for pattern generation
4. Add MIDI import functionality to complement the existing export feature
5. Develop a more sophisticated UI for pattern editing and visualization
