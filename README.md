## System Architecture

The architecture consists of the following core components:

1. **Audio Engine**: Real-time C++ audio processing with digital synthesis
2. **Effects System**: Modular audio effects chain
3. **Sequencer**: Pattern-based sequencer with timing and note events
4. **Adaptive Sequencer**: Game audio-inspired dynamic music system with state transitions
5. **MIDI Integration**: Hardware connectivity via MIDI protocol
6. **Hardware Interface**: Physical controls and display interface
7. **LLM Integration**:
   - Voice/text to synthesizer parameter suggestions
   - Pattern completion and suggestion for sequencer
   - User preference learning for customized assistance
   - Musical context awareness

## LLM Features

The LLM component acts as a creative copilot with these capabilities:

- Parameter suggestion based on descriptive language (e.g., "make it sound brighter" or "more aggressive")
- Pattern suggestions and completions for the sequencer
- Learning user preferences over time to offer more personalized suggestions
- Contextual music theory assistance

## Technical Implementation

1. Implement the C++ source files based on the header interfaces
2. Choose and integrate audio/MIDI libraries (RtAudio/RtMidi included in CMake)
3. Select an LLM for embedding (consider ONNX Runtime for optimized models)
4. Design and implement the hardware interface components
5. Develop the synthesizer engine with multiple oscillator types
6. Create the effects processing chain
7. Implement the pattern sequencer with MIDI I/O
8. Integrate the LLM with audio parameter mapping

## Hardware Interface Considerations

- Knobs with screens for parameter visualization
- Touch surfaces for expressive control
- LED feedback for sequencer and status
- Display for LLM interaction and suggestions
- MIDI connectivity for external devices

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Develop a functional software prototype**
   - Create a minimal C++ audio engine implementation
   - Implement basic synthesis engine
   - Test LLM integration with an existing model

2. **Design hardware proof-of-concept**
   - Create simple controller layout with key inputs
   - Build interface for the LLM component
   - Test hardware-software communication

3. **Validate core concept**
   - Get early feedback from potential users
   - Test audio quality and latency
   - Evaluate LLM responsiveness and usefulness

4. **Secure initial funding**
   - Prepare pitch materials based on prototype
   - Explore grant opportunities for music tech
   - Consider angel investors with music industry experience

5. **Engage with prototype manufacturer**
   - Contact manufacturers with music hardware experience
   - Get preliminary quotes for prototype development
   - Discuss timeline and requirements

6. **Plan for IP protection**
   - Consider provisional patents for unique aspects
   - Secure trademarks for product name
   - Establish clear copyright for software components

7. **Develop go-to-market strategy**
   - Determine initial pricing strategy
   - Plan crowdfunding campaign structure
   - Identify key influencers in electronic music space

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies:
   - C++ compiler with C++17 support
   - CMake 3.14 or higher
   - RtAudio library (optional but recommended for real-time audio)

2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```

3. Run examples:
   ```bash
   # Simple audio test (generates WAV files)
   ./bin/SimpleTest
   
   # Sequencer test (generates sequencer patterns as WAV files)
   ./bin/TestSequencerFile
   
   # Advanced sequencer features
   ./bin/TestSequencerAdvanced
   
   # If RtAudio is available:
   # Real-time audio playback
   ./bin/TestAudio
   
   # Sequencer with real-time audio
   ./bin/TestSequencer
   
   # Adaptive Sequencer demo
   ./bin/TestAdaptiveSequencer
   
   # If SDL2 is available:
   # UI visualization test
   ./bin/TestUI
   ```

## Key Features

### Custom UI Framework
The UI framework provides a minimalist, hardware-oriented interface inspired by the Teenage Engineering OP-1:

- **Direct Framebuffer Access**: No dependencies on external UI frameworks
- **Music-Specific Components**: Specialized UI elements for music production
- **Hardware Integration**: Support for physical controls and touch interfaces
- **Theming System**: Consistent color palette with easy customization
- **Performance Focused**: Optimized for embedded hardware

For more information, see [UI Implementation Documentation](docs/UI_IMPLEMENTATION.md).

### Adaptive Sequencer
The AdaptiveSequencer is a state-based music sequencing system inspired by game audio middleware:

- **State-Based Architecture**: Musical states with transition rules
- **Event-Driven Design**: Trigger events for state changes and musical transitions
- **Layered Composition**: Dynamic control over musical layers and mixing
- **Hardware Integration**: Intuitive physical control over adaptive music system
- **Parameter-Driven**: Real-time control values that influence musical behavior
