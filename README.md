  - `ai/` - LLM integration code
  - `ui/` - User interface code
  - `hardware/` - Hardware interface code
  - `sequencer/` - Sequencer implementation

## System Architecture

The architecture consists of the following core components:

1. **Audio Engine**: Real-time C++ audio processing with digital synthesis
2. **Effects System**: Modular audio effects chain
3. **Sequencer**: Pattern-based sequencer with timing and note events
4. **MIDI Integration**: Hardware connectivity via MIDI protocol
5. **Hardware Interface**: Physical controls and display interface
6. **LLM Integration**:
   - Voice/text to synthesizer parameter suggestions
   - Pattern completion and suggestion for sequencer
   - User preference learning for customized assistance
   - Musical context awareness

## LLM Features

The LLM component acts as a creative copilot with these capabilities:

- Parameter suggestion based on descriptive language (e.g., "make it sound brighter" or "more aggressive")
- Pattern suggestions and completions for the sequencer
- Learning user preferences over time to offer more personalized suggestions
- Contextual music theory assistance

## Technical Implementation

1. Implement the C++ source files based on the header interfaces
2. Choose and integrate audio/MIDI libraries (RtAudio/RtMidi included in CMake)
3. Select an LLM for embedding (consider ONNX Runtime for optimized models)
4. Design and implement the hardware interface components
5. Develop the synthesizer engine with multiple oscillator types
6. Create the effects processing chain
7. Implement the pattern sequencer with MIDI I/O
8. Integrate the LLM with audio parameter mapping

## Hardware Interface Considerations

- Knobs with screens for parameter visualization
- Touch surfaces for expressive control
- LED feedback for sequencer and status
- Display for LLM interaction and suggestions
- MIDI connectivity for external devices

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Develop a functional software prototype**
   - Create a minimal C++ audio engine implementation
   - Implement basic synthesis engine
   - Test LLM integration with an existing model

2. **Design hardware proof-of-concept**
   - Create simple controller layout with key inputs
   - Build interface for the LLM component
   - Test hardware-software communication

3. **Validate core concept**
   - Get early feedback from potential users
   - Test audio quality and latency
   - Evaluate LLM responsiveness and usefulness

4. **Secure initial funding**
   - Prepare pitch materials based on prototype
   - Explore grant opportunities for music tech
   - Consider angel investors with music industry experience

5. **Engage with prototype manufacturer**
   - Contact manufacturers with music hardware experience
   - Get preliminary quotes for prototype development
   - Discuss timeline and requirements

6. **Plan for IP protection**
   - Consider provisional patents for unique aspects
   - Secure trademarks for product name
   - Establish clear copyright for software components

7. **Develop go-to-market strategy**
   - Determine initial pricing strategy
   - Plan crowdfunding campaign structure
   - Identify key influencers in electronic music space
