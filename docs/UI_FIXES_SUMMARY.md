# UI Fixes Summary

## Date: November 6, 2025 (Updated from October 6, 2025)

This document summarizes the major UI fixes and improvements implemented to address various issues with the synthesizer interface.

## 1. MIDI Keyboard Drag Crash Fix

### Problem
- Application crashed when dragging mouse outside the MIDI keyboard boundaries
- Invalid pointer access when `lastHoveredKey_` became null during drag operations

### Solution
- Replaced `lastHoveredKey_` pointer with `draggingNote_` integer to track the note being dragged
- Added bounds checking in mouse event handlers
- Implemented proper `setPosition()` and `setSize()` overrides to regenerate key layout when keyboard is repositioned

### Code Changes
```cpp
// Before (unsafe):
Key* lastHoveredKey_ = nullptr;

// After (safe):
int draggingNote_ = -1;  // -1 means no note being dragged
```

## 2. Grid Layout System Implementation

### Problem
- "Absolute positioning seems like a crazy way to work" - manual positioning of every UI component
- Difficult to maintain consistent spacing and alignment
- No automatic layout management

### Solution
Implemented a comprehensive `GridLayout` class with:
- Automatic component positioning based on grid cells
- Support for components spanning multiple rows/columns
- Configurable padding and spacing
- Batch mode to prevent layout thrashing during initialization

### Key Features
```cpp
// Create a grid with 6 rows and 8 columns
auto mainGrid = std::make_unique<GridLayout>("main_grid", 6, 8);
mainGrid->setPadding(20);
mainGrid->setSpacing(10, 10);

// Batch mode prevents premature layout calculations
mainGrid->beginBatchAdd();
// ... add components ...
mainGrid->endBatchAdd();  // Triggers layout calculation
```

## 3. Components Rendering at Origin (0,0)

### Problem
- 6 UI components were rendering at the top-left corner (0,0) before being properly positioned
- Components were visible during initialization phase with default positions

### Root Cause
- UIComponent base class initializes with `x_(0), y_(0), width_(0), height_(0)`
- Components render immediately but `layoutComponents()` is called later
- Grid layout positions components AFTER they're added to the parent

### Solution
Added defensive rendering checks to prevent rendering uninitialized components:

```cpp
// Don't render if at origin with small size (not yet positioned)
if (x_ == 0 && y_ == 0 && width_ <= 200 && height_ <= 200) return;
```

### Components Fixed
1. **PresetSearchBox** - Was showing "Search pres..." text at origin
2. **PresetListView** - List container rendering before positioning
3. **PresetListItem** - Individual list items
4. **PresetCategoryFilter** - Category filter buttons
5. **Label** - Generic label components
6. **Icon** - Icon components

## 4. Audio Latency Reduction

### Problem
- Noticeable delay between pressing a key and hearing sound
- Default buffer size of 512 frames caused ~23ms total latency

### Solution
Reduced audio buffer size for lower latency:

```cpp
// Before:
auto audioEngine = std::make_unique<AudioEngine>();  // Default: 512 frames

// After:
auto audioEngine = std::make_unique<AudioEngine>(44100, 128);  // 128 frames
```

### Latency Comparison
- **512 frames**: ~11.6ms per buffer (23.2ms with double buffering)
- **256 frames**: ~5.8ms per buffer (11.6ms with double buffering)
- **128 frames**: ~2.9ms per buffer (5.8ms with double buffering)

### Notes
- Lower buffer sizes may cause audio glitches on slower systems
- UI processing adds minimal latency (1-2ms)
- Real-time thread priority already enabled via `RTAUDIO_SCHEDULE_REALTIME`

## 5. SDL_ttf Font Rendering Integration

### Problem
- Labels were rendering as solid rectangles
- No actual text visible in the UI
- Fallback rendering code was drawing rectangles instead of text

### Solution
1. Integrated SDL_ttf library for proper font rendering
2. Implemented multi-size font system:
   - 14pt for normal text
   - 18pt for headers/sections
   - 12pt for small labels
3. Removed all fallback rectangle rendering code

### Implementation
```cpp
// SDLDisplayManager constructor
TTF_Init();
font_ = TTF_OpenFont("/System/Library/Fonts/Helvetica.ttc", 14);
fontLarge_ = TTF_OpenFont("/System/Library/Fonts/Helvetica.ttc", 18);
fontSmall_ = TTF_OpenFont("/System/Library/Fonts/Helvetica.ttc", 12);
```

## Technical Insights

### Component Lifecycle
1. Component created with default position (0,0) and size (0,0)
2. Component added to parent container
3. Parent's `layoutComponents()` called (often triggered by `setSize()` or `setPosition()`)
4. Component receives proper position and size
5. Component renders at correct location

### Grid Layout Timing
- Grid calculates layout only after:
  - It has been positioned within its parent
  - Batch mode is ended (if used)
  - Its own size has been set
- This prevents unnecessary layout calculations during initialization

### Performance Considerations
- Batch mode prevents O(nÂ²) layout calculations when adding many components
- Position checks prevent unnecessary rendering of uninitialized components
- Layout is recalculated only when needed (size/position changes)

## Future Improvements

1. **Dynamic Layout Support**: Add support for responsive layouts that adjust to window resizing
2. **Layout Animations**: Smooth transitions when components move or resize
3. **Additional Layout Types**: FlexBox-style layout, dock layout, etc.
4. **Improved Audio System**: Automatic buffer size selection based on system capabilities
5. **Component Pooling**: Reuse component instances to reduce allocation overhead

## 6. Envelope Visualizer Release Handle Fix

### Problem
- EnvelopeVisualizer was only showing 3 handles (Attack, Decay, Sustain)
- Release handle was missing, making it impossible to adjust release time visually

### Solution
Modified the envelope visualizer to include all 4 ADSR handles:
- Attack handle at the attack point
- Decay handle at the decay point  
- Sustain handle for vertical sustain level adjustment
- Release handle at the release endpoint

### Implementation
The fix ensures all 4 envelope stages can be edited interactively, matching the behavior of professional synthesizers like Vital.

## 7. Filter Visualizer Implementation

### Problem
- No visual feedback for filter frequency response
- Users couldn't see how cutoff and resonance affected the sound

### Solution
Implemented a Vital-style FilterVisualizer component with:
- Real-time frequency response curve visualization
- Interactive cutoff and resonance control via draggable handles
- Logarithmic frequency scaling (20Hz at 0, 500Hz at 0.5, 20kHz at 1.0)
- Grid overlay for frequency reference
- Feedback loop prevention between parameter updates

### Technical Details
```cpp
// Logarithmic cutoff mapping
float cutoffToFrequency(float normalized) {
    const float minFreq = 20.0f;
    const float maxFreq = 20000.0f;
    return minFreq * std::pow(maxFreq / minFreq, normalized);
}
```

## 8. Dropdown Z-Order Fix

### Problem
- Dropdown menus were rendering behind other UI elements
- Made modulation routing dropdowns unusable

### Solution
- Implemented proper z-order management for dropdown overlays
- Dropdowns now render on top of all other UI elements
- Fixed clipping issues with dropdown lists

## 9. Effect Processor Crash Fixes

### Problem
- Reverb, Distortion, and Phaser effects were causing crashes
- Null pointer exceptions when effects were bypassed

### Solution
- Added proper null checks in effect processing chains
- Fixed initialization order for effect parameters
- Implemented safe bypass handling
- Added bounds checking for effect parameters

## 10. Filter Control Input Handling

### Problem
- Filter cutoff and resonance sliders were not responding to input
- Feedback loop between visualizer and parameter updates

### Solution
- Implemented `isUpdatingFromParameter_` flag to prevent feedback loops
- Fixed event handling in FilterVisualizer to properly process mouse input
- Ensured bidirectional updates work correctly between sliders and visualizer

## Conclusion

These fixes significantly improve the stability and usability of the UI system. The grid layout provides a much more maintainable approach to component positioning, while the rendering checks ensure a clean visual experience during initialization. The reduced audio latency makes the synthesizer more responsive and suitable for live performance.

The recent additions of the filter visualizer, modulation routing UI, and effects chain controls bring the interface up to professional standards, matching the functionality found in commercial synthesizers like Vital. The envelope visualizer fix ensures all ADSR parameters can be edited visually, completing the core synthesis control interface.
