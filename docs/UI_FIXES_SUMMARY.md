# UI Fixes Summary

This document describes the fixes applied to resolve three UI issues in the synthesizer.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Overlapping Boxes - UI Elements Positioned Too Close Together

**Problem:** UI elements were overlapping due to insufficient spacing between components.

**Solution:** 
- Increased horizontal spacing between knobs from 130 pixels to 150 pixels
- Adjusted oscillator section knobs: Frequency at x=50, Detune at x=200
- Moved filter section to x=400 with Cutoff at x=400, Resonance at x=550
- Adjusted visualization components positioning and reduced their sizes slightly for better fit
- Moved visualization section down from y=200 to y=230 for better vertical spacing
- Adjusted preset browser and performance panels for better layout

### 2. Missing Labels - Labels Not Rendering Properly on UI Components

**Problem:** Knob labels were not visible when Font objects were not available (TODO in code).

**Solution:**
- Implemented improved fallback rendering for labels when fonts are unavailable
- Added background rectangles behind label text for better visibility
- Render each character as a small filled rectangle to simulate text
- Added similar fallback rendering for value display
- Improved visibility with background colors (dark gray) behind text areas
- Special handling for decimal points in value display

### 3. Envelope Editor Not Affecting Sound

**Problem:** The envelope visualization was not connected to synthesizer parameters.

**Solution:**
- Created envelope parameters in the parameter manager:
  - `env_attack` (0.001-2.0s)
  - `env_decay` (0.001-2.0s)  
  - `env_sustain` (0.0-1.0)
  - `env_release` (0.001-5.0s)
- Connected the EnvelopeVisualizer's callback to update both:
  - Parameter manager values
  - Synthesizer parameters directly
- Used the correct callback method name: `setParameterChangeCallback`

## Code Changes

### Modified Files:
1. `/Users/geaspar/AIMusicHardware/src/main_integrated.cpp`
   - Adjusted UI component positioning
   - Added envelope parameters
   - Connected envelope editor to synthesizer

2. `/Users/geaspar/AIMusicHardware/src/ui/UIComponents.cpp`
   - Improved label rendering fallback
   - Added background rectangles for text visibility
   - Enhanced value display rendering

## Testing

To test the fixes:

1. Build the project:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/geaspar/AIMusicHardware/build
   make -j4
   ```

2. Run the integrated UI demo:
   ```bash
   ./bin/AIMusicHardwareIntegrated
   ```

3. Verify:
   - All UI elements have proper spacing without overlap
   - Knob labels are visible even without font rendering
   - Moving the envelope handles updates the synthesizer sound in real-time

## Future Improvements

1. Implement proper font loading using SDL_ttf for better text rendering
2. Add visual feedback when envelope parameters are being modulated
3. Consider adding preset save/load functionality for envelope settings
4. Add parameter value tooltips on hover
