## May 11, 2025 - Advanced Filter System Implementation

We've designed and implemented a comprehensive advanced filter system with multiple filter types and blending capabilities:

1. **Modular Filter Architecture**
   - Created a flexible `FilterModel` base class for all filter implementations
   - Implemented `AdvancedFilter` class to manage filter models with blending support
   - Designed an extensible system that can be easily expanded with new filter types
   - Created a unified parameter interface for consistent control

2. **Multiple Filter Implementations**
   - Enhanced the basic biquad filters (low pass, high pass, band pass, notch)
   - Implemented Moog-style ladder filter with analog-inspired characteristics
   - Created comb filter with feedback and modulation for phaser/flanger effects
   - Developed formant filter for vowel-like sounds with gender and morphing controls

3. **Filter Blending Mechanism**
   - Added the ability to blend between any two filter types
   - Implemented parallel processing with smooth crossfading
   - Created intuitive controls for blend amount and type selection
   - Enabled unique hybrid sounds not possible with single filter types

4. **Parameter Control System**
   - Added specialized parameters for each filter type
   - Implemented parameter normalization for intuitive control
   - Created smooth parameter transitions to prevent artifacts
   - Designed consistent parameter ranges across filter types

5. **Testing and Demonstration**
   - Created comprehensive `AdvancedFilterDemo` application
   - Implemented interactive parameter control via command line
   - Added multiple audio source types for filter testing
   - Created MIDI note input for musical evaluation

6. **Documentation**
   - Created detailed `ADVANCED_FILTER_SYSTEM.md` documentation
   - Documented the architecture, filter types, and blending capabilities
   - Added usage examples and code snippets
   - Included future enhancement possibilities

This implementation significantly enhances the sound design capabilities of our synthesizer with professional-quality filters comparable to high-end software instruments. The filter blending functionality, in particular, enables unique sounds not possible with traditional filter designs.

## May 11, 2025 - Advanced Oscillator Stacking Implementation

We've successfully implemented oscillator stacking with detune capabilities to create richer and wider sounds:

1. **Oscillator Stack Architecture**
   - Created `OscillatorStack` class to manage multiple oscillators per voice (up to 8)
   - Implemented detune spread with various distribution types (even, center-weighted, alternating)
   - Added stereo width control through oscillator panning
   - Implemented level convergence for more focused unison sounds
   - Built configurable presets for common unison configurations

2. **Voice Architecture Extensions**
   - Implemented `StackedVoice` class extending the base `Voice` class
   - Created stereo output capabilities with proper panning
   - Added comprehensive parameter control for detune and stereo width
   - Implemented real-time parameter adjustment capabilities
   - Built backward compatibility with existing voice architecture

3. **Voice Manager Integration**
   - Created `StackedVoiceManager` to generate and control stacked voices
   - Implemented global control of oscillator stacking parameters
   - Added automatic configuration of new voices with current settings
   - Maintained compatibility with existing VoiceManager API
   - Built thread-safe parameter updates for all voices

4. **Testing and Demonstration**
   - Created `OscillatorStackDemo` application for interactive testing
   - Implemented real-time parameter control with console interface
   - Added comprehensive demonstration of all unison capabilities
   - Created audio test patterns for various configurations
   - Built command-based interface for exploring parameters

5. **Documentation**
   - Created detailed `OSCILLATOR_STACKING.md` documentation
   - Documented the architecture, classes, and implementation
   - Added usage examples and best practices
   - Included technical details and integration guidance
   - Added audio considerations and optimization notes

This implementation significantly enhances the sound design capabilities of our synthesizer with rich, professional-quality unison and stacking features comparable to high-end soft synths. The architecture is designed for efficiency and seamless integration with our existing voice management system. The OscillatorStackDemo application provides an interactive test environment for exploring the sonic possibilities of the stacked oscillator system.
