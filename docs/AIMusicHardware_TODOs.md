- ‚úÖ **ESP32 Hardware Design Complete**: Full electrical schematics, PCB layouts, and mechanical design
- ‚úÖ **3D Enclosure Design**: IP54-rated enclosure with proper ventilation and mounting systems
- ‚úÖ **Production Firmware**: Complete ESP32 sensor node firmware with all sensor integration
- ‚úÖ **Manufacturing Documentation**: Prototyping guide, BOM, cost analysis, and DFM specifications
- ‚úÖ **Battery Optimization**: 5+ day operation with optimized power management

### Previously Completed
- ‚úÖ Game Audio Middleware implementation (State-Based Music, Vertical Remix, RTPC)
- ‚úÖ MPE Voice Manager with full polyphonic expression support
- ‚úÖ Advanced Filter System with multiple filter types and blending
- ‚úÖ Oscillator Stacking with detune and stereo width capabilities
- ‚úÖ Effects Processing with reorderable chains and MIDI control
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive MIDI implementation with keyboard and controller support

## Partially Completed Tasks
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Improved UI interactive components, particularly filter controls (needs additional work)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Enhanced text rendering and visual elements in the UI (still some rendering issues)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Implemented better knob interactivity with specialized modes for different parameter types
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Created more comprehensive testing with the TestUI application
- üèóÔ∏è Designed comprehensive preset management system (implementation in progress)

## Current Priority Tasks

1. **Preset Management System Implementation**
   - ‚úÖ Designed preset file format using JSON
   - ‚úÖ Created data models and class architecture
   - ‚úÖ Designed UI components for preset browser and save dialog
   - ‚è≥ Implement PresetManager backend functionality
   - ‚è≥ Implement PresetBrowser UI components
   - ‚è≥ Implement PresetSaveDialog and related input components
   - ‚è≥ Connect preset system to parameter management
   - ‚è≥ Add import/export capabilities

2. **System Integration**
   - Connect all UI components to their respective audio parameters
   - Ensure bidirectional updates between UI and synth engine
   - Implement proper parameter binding for all controls
   - Create central parameter management system

3. **Complete Testing Suite**
   - Develop comprehensive tests for all UI components
   - Create performance benchmarks for rendering and interaction
   - Test UI responsiveness during heavy audio processing
   - Validate memory management during extended use

## Audio Engine Improvements
- Fix note-off timing and handling - currently cutting off sequences prematurely
- Implement proper voice allocation and tracking to fix polyphony issues
- Fine-tune the envelope processing to ensure smoother release stages
- Consider adding a proper voice manager to track which voices are playing which notes

## Potential Enhancement Paths

1. **Pattern Editing Interface**
   - Create a simple console-based pattern editor
   - Allow real-time addition, removal, and editing of notes
   - Support step sequencing and live input modes

2. **Effect Processing**
   - Add audio effects (reverb, delay, filter, etc.)
   - Create an effect chain system with configurable parameters
   - Implement per-pattern or per-channel effect routing

3. **MIDI Import/Export**
   - Enhance existing MIDI capabilities to import external MIDI files
   - Implement MIDI file parsing and conversion to internal pattern format
   - Add MIDI file export with full song arrangement support

4. **AI-Assisted Pattern Generation**
   - Implement simple algorithms for melodic/rhythmic pattern generation
   - Add options for user-defined constraints (scale, chord progression, etc.)
   - Create variation generator for existing patterns

5. **Programmable Modulation**
   - Add LFOs (Low-Frequency Oscillators) for parameter modulation
   - Implement envelope generators for dynamic control
   - Create modulation matrix for routing modulators to parameters
