# AdaptiveSequencer: Game Audio-Inspired Dynamic Music System

## Overview
The AdaptiveSequencer is a state-based music sequencing system inspired by game audio middleware like FMOD, Wwise, and other interactive audio engines. It provides a flexible framework for creating dynamic, responsive musical compositions that can adapt to changing conditions, similar to how game audio responds to player actions and game states.

## Core Concepts

### 1. State-Based Architecture
- **Musical States**: Discrete musical sections (themes, variations, intensity levels)
- **State Transitions**: Rules for moving between musical states
- **Parameter Mapping**: Dynamic variables that influence state transitions and audio properties

### 2. Event-Driven Design
- **Trigger Events**: Signals that can initiate state changes, parameter shifts, or other actions
- **Listener System**: Components that monitor and respond to events
- **Action Queuing**: Priority-based system for scheduling musical events

### 3. Layered Composition
- **Track Layers**: Multiple concurrent musical layers (bass, rhythm, melody, etc.)
- **Dynamic Mixing**: Real-time control of layer volumes, effects, and other properties
- **Crossfading**: Smooth transitions between musical elements

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Framework (2-3 weeks)
- Design and implement base classes for the AdaptiveSequencer
- Create the state machine architecture
- Implement basic event system
- Build parameter management system
- Integrate with existing AudioEngine and Synthesizer components

### Phase 2: Musical Features (2-3 weeks)
- Implement layered track system
- Create transition management (crossfades, musical transitions)
- Add MIDI integration for state data
- Develop pattern generators and arpeggiators
- Build quantization and timing utilities

### Phase 3: Integration and Examples (1-2 weeks)
- Create demonstration scenarios showing adaptive music capabilities
- Integrate with existing project components
- Optimize performance for real-time use
- Document API and usage patterns

### Phase 4: Testing and Refinement (1-2 weeks)
- Create comprehensive tests for all components
- Stress test with complex musical scenarios
- Profile and optimize for performance
- User testing and feedback incorporation

## Technical Design

### Key Classes

1. **AdaptiveSequencer**: Main controller class
2. **MusicState**: Represents a discrete musical section or theme
3. **StateTransition**: Rules for moving between states
4. **Parameter**: Dynamic variables that influence the system
5. **EventSystem**: Handles trigger events and listeners
6. **TrackLayer**: Individual musical component that can be mixed
7. **MixSnapshot**: Represents a particular mix of track layers
8. **TransitionManager**: Handles smooth transitions between states

### Integration Points

- **AudioEngine**: For sound generation and playback
- **Synthesizer**: For generating musical tones
- **MidiFile**: For loading pre-composed musical content
- **EffectProcessor**: For applying audio effects to musical layers

## Use Cases

1. **Adaptive Background Music**
   - Music that responds to environmental or emotional context
   - Seamless transitions between moods or energy levels

2. **Interactive Composition**
   - Musical systems that respond to user input
   - Real-time modification of musical elements

3. **Procedural Music Generation**
   - Rule-based generation of musical content
   - Parameter-driven variation of musical patterns

4. **Tension and Release Systems**
   - Dynamics that build and release musical tension
   - Layered approach to creating musical drama

## Resources & Inspiration

- FMOD's event-based system
- Wwise's state management
- Elias Studio's adaptive music approach
- Pure Data's signal flow concepts
- Unity's audio mixer snapshots

## Next Steps

1. Define detailed class interfaces
