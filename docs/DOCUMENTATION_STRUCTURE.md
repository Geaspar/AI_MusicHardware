## Documentation Usage Guidelines

### For New Users
1. Start with `PROJECT_STATUS.md` for project overview
2. Read relevant guides: `UI_GUIDE.md`, `SEQUENCER_GUIDE.md`, `IOT_MQTT_GUIDE.md`
3. Refer to hardware docs if building physical devices

### For Developers
1. Review `PROJECT_STATUS.md` for current status
2. Study technical references for implementation details
3. Use testing guides for validation procedures
4. Refer to specialized docs for specific subsystems

### For Contributors
1. Check `PROJECT_STATUS.md` for current priorities
2. Review technical specs before making changes
3. Update relevant guides when adding features
4. Ensure all changes are documented appropriately

## Quality Standards

### Documentation Requirements
- **User Guides**: Focus on practical usage with clear examples
- **Technical Docs**: Complete implementation details with code examples
- **Testing Guides**: Step-by-step validation procedures
- **Status Docs**: Current state, metrics, and roadmap

### Maintenance
- All documents include last updated date
- Cross-references maintained between related documents
- Examples tested and validated
- Performance metrics regularly updated

## Key Benefits of New Structure

1. **Eliminated Duplication**: No more conflicting information across files
2. **Clear Separation**: User guides vs technical implementation details
3. **Better Discoverability**: Logical naming and organization
4. **Reduced Maintenance**: Fewer files to keep updated
5. **Professional Organization**: Suitable for both open-source and commercial use

This structure provides a professional, maintainable documentation system that serves both users and developers while eliminating the confusion from overlapping content.
